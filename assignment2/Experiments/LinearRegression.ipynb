      "We went for a girls long weekend trip. The hotel is very nice, the rooms extra clean and comfortable. The pool area is beautiful. We did notice this is a very popular hotel for couples, there were a few families while we were there, but not that many children. All of the hotel staff was very friendly, and went above and beyond to accommodate anything we needed. It was such a nice, relaxing weekend. Some pluses: drinks by the pool (on the pricey side, but were good), service to the beach chairs out on the beach, and walking distance to several good restaurants and nightclubs. Also, you are an easy taxi ride to spend a day in Old San Juan ($19 each way), and about an hour to El Yunque rainforest. I highly recommend renting a car for a day and making that trip. Swimming in the waterfall is an amazing (albeit cold!) experience. You can rent a car at the hotel from Avis. You will save money if you go online and rent vs doing it at the counter. Also keep in mind if you rent a car and keep it overnight you will have to pay the parking fee for the hotel...and it wasn't cheap, 20 or 25 a night I believe. The only hotel restaurant we ate at was the sushi restaurant, and I can say it was so good we went back again!! Also, Platos is a local restaurant within walking distance, go try the lobster mofungo..delish!! There is a small casino, we didn't use it. My only real complaint is that they don't have a nice lounge onsite with music...that would be a real plus. But since there are several within walking distance, this would not stop us from staying here again. In fact, we will definitely be back!!\n"

      "Stayed here in August 2005, bit of a delay in writing review!!! Location: Good location, just around the corner from various plazas, 10 minutes walk from Puerto Del Sol. Hotel: receptionist friendly and helpful. Hotel can appear a bit dark inside due to decor, but v clean and modern. Room: Quite small room, and appears dingy at times due to decor. But spotless and enough space and storage for 2 people. Bathroom is stunning - perfect for girls geting ready to go out. Big mirrors and good lighting. Power shower, big bath and 2 bowl sinks. Bathroom door is frosted glass so limited privacy at times. Bed is big but firm. Air con worked a treat. Didnt spend much time in hotel room anyway - there's too much to see. Sight-seeing: Get tickets for the tour buses so you can hop-on and off whenever you like. You'll get to see al the attractions and find things you want to see inc various plazas, stadium etc. Madrid is wonderful, enjoy it!\n",

      "Content of review: Stayed here in August 2005, bit of a delay in writing review!!! Location: Good location, just around the corner from various plazas, 10 minutes walk from Puerto Del Sol. Hotel: receptionist friendly and helpful. Hotel can appear a bit dark inside due to decor, but v clean and modern. Room: Quite small room, and appears dingy at times due to decor. But spotless and enough space and storage for 2 people. Bathroom is stunning - perfect for girls geting ready to go out. Big mirrors and good lighting. Power shower, big bath and 2 bowl sinks. Bathroom door is frosted glass so limited privacy at times. Bed is big but firm. Air con worked a treat. Didnt spend much time in hotel room anyway - there's too much to see. Sight-seeing: Get tickets for the tour buses so you can hop-on and off whenever you like. You'll get to see al the attractions and find things you want to see inc various plazas, stadium etc. Madrid is wonderful, enjoy it!\n",

      "I have been to Vegas many times and have walked thru the Aria lobby/casino but this was the first stay there as we were attending the Cirque Viva Elvis show and wanted to stay close by. Let's start with the basic pluses; newer hotel so rooms are in great shape; beds are very comfortable and you can get a good nights sleep there (once you make it to your room)!; everything in your room run by your remote which is great when the batteries are working (had to have maintenance come and change those when we checked in as nothing worked with the remote); Minuses: buffet is good value but selection is not as good as the Bellagio (you must eat at Bellagio one time as it is incredible for a buffet!); food at the Jean Phillipe cafe in the lobby and little cafe on the second floor is really expensive for just a sandwich with just OK panini sandwiches; hotel has a strong \"waffle cone\" smell when you walk in the door (most likely from the Jean Phillipe place in the lobby) and does not go away - it gets a little overwhelming after a while; slot machines were not paying out for any of our group of 4 during the 3 days we were there (always seem to do better at Paris and Bellagio for some reason Might consider staying there again, but if I can get the same rate at the Bellagio would pick that any day over the Aria\n",

From the moment they checked in they loved the place, My daughter loved the parrots in the lobby and the pool was one of the best I have seen but the best of all for a 3 year old was a fantastic beach in the middle of Orlando! They even gave her a bucket and spade. The room was fantastic and we had a good pool view. We were so impressed we checked in again one week later as we had to spend a night in Orlando before our flight back to the UK.\n",

      "The transformation from Alladin to Planet Hollywood is just about complete. Terrific center-Strip location. Rock music in all the public spaces and the casino. And a generally \"cool\" presence, without pushing it to absurd levels. A great range of eateries from the very economical Earl of Sandwich through moderates Planet Dailies, P. J. Changs and the Spice Market Buffet ( a great-value Vegas buffet), right on up to the pricey KOI and Strip House. Stayed in a Hollywood Hip room decorated with Robert Redford memorabilia ... all the rooms apparently feature star treasures. Generous sized room, excellent mattress on the king bed, 42\" Plasma TV, soaker tub. Front desk staff friendly, helpful, though the line up is way too long at peak times. I say the transformation is \"almost complete\" ... for example, the advertised HD TV wasn't yet available on the higher floors - still being installed. We went to the pools all five mornings we were there. First four, we simply walked out the door to the deck. On the last day, elfs or someone had completely replaced all of the doors out to the pool and you now needed your room keycard to get outside. I mentioned this to the pool attendant, with a laugh and a \"something new every day here ... today you need your keycard to get out to the pool!\" He looked puzzled and said \"You do?\". The website is pretty representative of the actual property. All in all a really great experience! I'm recommending to all my friends.\n",

The location's perfect for seeing the sights of Hollywood being just a short walk from the Walk of Fame and restaurants, yet it's a little off the main drag so is nice and quiet. This is probably the best Holiday Inn we stayed in. There was a nice pool, the staff were friendly and helpful and the room was modern and immaculately clean. Free wifi access was nice and our kids loved the choice of TV stations! Breakfast offers a good choice of cooked and continental. When I compare this to a 5 star hotel we stayed in at about three times the price, in terms of value for money, there is no comparison. If anything the Holiday Inn front desk staff were more helpful. Would definitely stay here again.\n",

      "We are seasoned Disney travellers, being part of the Vacation Club, but this is the first time we have stayed at Saratoga Springs. The resort is fantastic! The location is superb (our apartment had a view over Downtown Disney) but is far enough away to be peaceful and quiet. The pool area is great for relaxing by and is far more tranquil than some of the other noisy pools in the Disney complexes (although we did come across another pool near the main reception area that had slides etc and loads of noisy kids!). Being a couple that go to Orlando to relax, shop, eat and drink, Saratoga is perfectly located to do just that. The rooms were gorgeous, as expected, with excellent facilities. There was one little gripe - our bathroom smelt of smoke all of the time and this (according to housekeeping) is down to poor ventilation and our neighbours smoking in their bathroom. Disney - you need to look at this!! Apart from that, relax and enjoy.\n",

      "I booked this hotel after reading the reviews , on Tripadvisor. The only travel agent, in UK, that I found that offered this hotel was Travel city direct. Anyway the hotel is in a good location, with several restaurants within walking distance. Its at the quieter end of International Drive, with good access to all the parks. So If you drive its a good hotel. The room is a good size with a door between the bedroom and sitting room. There is a huge fridge/freezer, microwave,dishwasher, toaster amd two electric rings. All the pots, pans and dishes you need are provided. There is also a iron & ironingboard, hairdryer and in-room safe. There is a breakast provided every morning, which is OK, and on Monday to Thursday there is a themed meal provided, with beer ,wine and soft drinks. The pool is in the middle of the hotel so it's shaded most of the day, but thats not the problem. The pool is about 3 foot at the shallowest, so could be a problem for young kids. So, so to sum up, this is the best hotel we have stayed in International drive, our 7th vist.\n",

      "We take 4 - 6 nice vacations each year. I am an avid user of Trip Advisor, but it is frustrating when I read negative reviews when we get there, the places are fabulous. Apparently, some people are never happy. We go to Vegas about twice a year, and usually stay at the Venetian (which is a bit grander and the rooms are all suites). We tried the Aria this time as the room was comped. The bed is heavenly, towels are wonderful, and the remote control for the TV and drapes is NOT hard to figure out. If you like a firm mattress, these are soft pillow tops. Check in was a very pleasant experience; our room was ready when we arrived at noon on Saturday, and we only waited in line about 10 minutes. We asked for a strip view, and Jennifer gave us a room with a spectacular view. One reviewer couldn't find the safe; we were told where to find it at check-in. Check out was also very convenient. We are non-smokers, and the casino seemed smoke free. Our clothes never smelled of smoke which was great. The cocktail service at the casino was also one of the best in Vegas. We tried the buffet, and it was also the best we have had in Vegas in terms of service, taste and cleanliness. All the staff at the Aria were very friendly. Here's a tip. You can walk inside from the Aria to the Monte Carlo. Along the way there is a nice food court including a McDonalds. We wen't there for breakfast and had Egg McMuffins - saved a lot of money! Another thing that I'm baffled about - those that said it's a long walk to the strip -walking is good for you, and it's not that far. There is also a free tram to the Bellagio from the Aria. Forget the negative reviews and just go there!\n",

My parents want to live in a suite like the one we stayed in. We arrived early morning due to a 10 hour wait/delay in Chicago and the staff were super at check in and even had someone help us with all of our bags to our building, we were in C. The bed is so comfortable and huge... and then the in the master bathroom the bathtub was so nice and so was the shower cubicle. There are three tvs, but we only used two. Everything you need to make meals are provided, except for spices and food itself. They even have an electronical tin opener. They have two pool areas, one that is mainly for adults and then the big pool area. I bet that is good at the peak seasons, but now hardly anyone was around when we went to the pool in the evening after Disney and shopping. Swimming in the pool at 8-9 pm in december surrounding by palm trees is what I call perfect. There are two elevators per building. Staff are superb and are there to help you with alot. You can even walk to one of the outlet malls from the hotel, although a short bit is walking on grass/gravel. But you can also take any of the buses that go by, I-ride, Lynx bus 8 and 42. There ought to be a crossing across International Drive to get to the bus stops on the other side, nr 42 goes to the Florida Mall. But the traffic was not heavy so we made it across.

      "My friend and I stayed two days and nights at the Ajia in late November and found it overpriced and awkward. It's overtly modern with a museum like lobby area made completely of polished granite and open to the ceiling, yet the staff was unfamiliar with the most basic elements of table service in their quite expensive restaurant. Even though we were the only diners, our glasses were always empty unless we called the waiter over to ask for another drink - including water! Also, the prices in the restaurant (such as the equivalent of $150 a bottle for Robert Mondavi Woodbridge Cabernet) were outrageous. After the first night in the hotel, one realizes why other hotels don't go with the \"museum marble/ open foyer\" look in their lobby. It was incredibly loud. Apparently, some of the staff had children present (?), but my friend and I were joking that it sounded like a daycare center because of the echoes of what were probably only 2 or 3 kids. Finally, the website pictures make it seem like its in a quiet green area. It's actually on a fairly busy street in a small local village that is not tourist friendly.

      "This hotel is modern and well designed with excellent staff who cannot do enough to help you. They speak excellent English and will happily arrange anything for you. Situated a few blocks from the main train station it is handily located for sightseeing with buses, the Metro and mainline trains all on your doorstep. The only negative about the location is that the area around the station is slightly suspect, particularly late at night. Also, there is a distinct lack of decent eating places locally. Having said that, we found that most restaurants in Rome were hideously overpriced and mediocre at best. Incidentally, we did a day trip to Florence by train and found that it was far superior to Rome in all areas. The rooms in the hotel are fairly compact but extremely clean and well set out. The breakfast of a morning is a cold buffet affair put perfectly reasonable. Be aware though that there isn't much soundproofing and the hotel is quite noisy of a nightime. If you are a light sleeper, the chances are you will be awoken by other guests returning late at night. Finally, don't bother going on any organised trips. Rome is totally overpriced and you can do most things cheaper yourself. Even the Roma Pass isn't that much of a bargain when you consider you can get a day ticket for all the buses and Metro for just 4 Euros. Out of all the places we visited, our favourite was the Catacombs.\n",

      "My wife and I recently stayed at this hotel for four days and found it to be a good place to start our vacation- the perfect base for our ventures in the valley. The hotel was packed with Napa Valley wine tasters yet the service was very good. The room was fairly large and very clean. (Every Marriot property I have stayed at has always been very clean) We had a first floor room with access to the garden courtyard. The chairs outside our room gave us an opportunity to try some of the wine we had purchased. The hotel’s location is a key reason to select it. It is located right off RT 29 and within walking distance of a Starbucks, Trader Joes and Target. It’s just a short drive to Rutherford and Yountville with their well known restaurants like Mustards and Ad Hoc and wineries like Mondavi and BV. And, it is very easy to get to the Hess Winery and to the Carneros Highway that will take you to Sonoma. We had breakfast at the hotel and the food was good. We talked to other visitors who had also had dinner there and they were pleased, if not surprised, with the quality of the food. If you decide to spend more time at the hotel, there is lots to do. You can participate in the wine tastings, visit the Spa and Salon, use the fitness room, sit around the fire pit at night and swim in the pool. Overall, we were very pleased with our stay. The property is very nice and the rooms were clean and reasonably priced for Napa Valley. The staff was very pleasant and very efficient.\n",

      "This is a lovely hotel on a nice street very near Bastille. The street is quiet during the day, but there are a few small restaurants so there is some noise in the evening (my room faced the street). Nevertheless, with window closed & earplugs I slept like a baby. For travel, you have two Metro lines at Bastille, a short walk to the Place des Vosges at one end of the street, and a 10 minute walk to the Seine at the other. Perfect. The staff were courteous and helpful, and the room was very nice. Though traveling alone, I booked a double since it was only a few euros more. The room was neither tiny nor huge, and was clean & well maintained. The bathroom likewise, with a good, strong shower. Breakfast was OK -- croissants, cafe creme, packaged cheese & yogurt.

      "My friend and I stayed two days and nights at the Ajia in late November and found it overpriced and awkward. It's overtly modern with a museum like lobby area made completely of polished granite and open to the ceiling, yet the staff was unfamiliar with the most basic elements of table service in their quite expensive restaurant. Even though we were the only diners, our glasses were always empty unless we called the waiter over to ask for another drink - including water! Also, the prices in the restaurant (such as the equivalent of $150 a bottle for Robert Mondavi Woodbridge Cabernet) were outrageous. After the first night in the hotel, one realizes why other hotels don't go with the \"museum marble/ open foyer\" look in their lobby. It was incredibly loud. Apparently, some of the staff had children present (?), but my friend and I were joking that it sounded like a daycare center because of the echoes of what were probably only 2 or 3 kids. Finally, the website pictures make it seem like its in a quiet green area. It's actually on a fairly busy street in a small local village that is not tourist friendly. One must take a boat across the Bosphorous in order to venture into a \"cute\" town with anything to do.\n",

      "Stayed here in October,2011, for 13 days, and couldn't be happier with accomodations, and especially the helpful staff. Located about 1 km north of the main railroad station, and about 1-l/2 km east of the Borghese Gardens, this villa (built in 1900) was about 100 meters from a bus and tram stop, and a 5-to-10 minute walk to Metro stop. In a quiet, tree-lined neighborhood within walking distance of really good, economical restaurants, perfect after a long day's touring, or even a hectic day of business. Rooms called small by other reviewers were spacious by European standards, my pal and I moved around easily. Terraces were available to all, complete with chaises-longues, for relaxing in the mild Roman nights. The pricing for rooms was low compared to the dubious privilege of staying in the Centro Storico, or anywhere near it, any why bother when you are 10 to 15 minutes by taxi or bus, tram or Metro away from almost anything you want to see? The staff, again, were warm, professional and totally helpful with directions, including maps, making reservations, etc. I love Rome, and stayed downtown and near it, but I'm staying here again.\n",

      "We stayed in this hotel a few weeks ago. After a long drive we were welcomed by the manager he was very chatty and friendly. The hotel is quite small with approx 8 rooms? Our room was at the back of the hotel and was very nice and adequate, the furnishings were all white wood with a large flatscreen TV on the wall, microwave and fridge. The bathroom was quite small but had a good walk in shower. We had a view of the beach from our bathroom only! it has a pretty roof garden and tables and chairs in the front to watch the sunset. we really enjoyed our stay at the hotel, the neighbour hood was nice and quiet with bars and restaurants nearby. Round the corner we booked surf lessons and hired rollerblades. As other reviewers have said the only real downside is the parking we stayed for 4 nights midweek and 2 of those we had to find parking on nearby roads, which was no real problem we just felt a little uneasy. Also we had to ask for fresh towels as only 3 were provided for 4 days. Other than that, this is a really beautiful little place to stay that we won't easily forget.\n",

The ride was great, nice weather and fun stops along the habor on the way over. We arrived at the Peal to warm greetings and relaxation at the pool with cold beverages. My gal loved the little note in the room from the hotel with the weather. We had reservations at another local restaurant for dinner but opted to stay at The Pearl instead, good choice. We sat at the bar with a nice gal (can't remembe her name, short black hair) and had a great meal.

      "I booked a room at the Tuscany based on the very low rate for the days I was traveling. Overall not a bad place if you don't mind staying off the strip an not really having a full hotel casino experience. The front desk was my only problem, first off you cannot check in until 3pm, most hotels post a certain time but will always let you check in a couple hours early, not the Tuscany. I have stayed in Vegas over 15 times in atleast 10 different hotels an was never denied checking in early. Now they will tell you you have the option to pay a extra fee to check in early, I believe it was around 13 dollars, which is clearly a way for them to make more money off their guests, very bad move. Okay so when you decide you don't want to pay the extra fee to check in early the extra charges do not stop there. When I went back at 3pm to check in I was told there is a 11.20 a day resort fee, what are you kidding me, so the cheap room you thought you booked just went up a extra 11.20 per night, another very bad move by the Tuscany, I will not stay there again due to those extra charges.\n",
